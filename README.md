### QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing)

This repository contains the code for QPE-FIT, which is a Bayesian parameter estimation tool to fit Quasi-Periodic Eruption timings with an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) orbit colliding with the accretion disk surrounding a massive black hole. In its currrent rendition, PE is performed with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), though there are future plans to explore other algorithms.
